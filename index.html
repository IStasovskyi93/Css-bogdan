        Jerusalem CNN — A desperately needed shipment of food aid destined for
        Gaza departed from Cyprus on Saturday, weeks after humanitarian efforts
        in the besieged enclave were severely disrupted following a deadly
        Israeli airstrike which killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK)
        workers.

        The deaths of the aid workers, six of them foreign, caused an
        international uproar against Israel, which took responsibility for the
        deaths. The incident also caused at least three aid providers to pause
        operations in Gaza, among them WCK, which had been central to the new,
        heavily touted sea corridor from Cyprus.

        The United Arab Emirates has now partnered with an aid agency to send
        crucial assistance to Gaza via the Israeli port of Ashdod. A UAE
        official told CNN Saturday that the vessel laden with critical food aid
        left on Saturday through a relationship with American Near East Refugee
        Aid (ANERA).

        The ship, called “Jennifer,” departed Larnaca Port in Cyprus at 9 a.m.
        local (2 a.m. ET) and will take around 25 to 30 hours to arrive at
        Israel&#39;s Ashdod port, according to ANERA&#39;s emergency response
        team lead in the West Bank, Mohenad Itayam.
